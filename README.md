# Gen Art Workshop

Workshop given to CU grads in the [Creative Technology and Design](https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/) department on Feb 13, 2025.

## Part 1

In [Part 1](part1), we'll explore some fun generative art algorithms built in [p5.js](https://p5js.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

1. [10 Print](1-10print)
2. [Loop + Tile + Randomness](2-loop-tile-incr-rand)
3. [Loop + Tile + Recursion](3-loop-tile-recursion)
4. [Recursive Tree](4-tree)
5. [Circle Packing](5-circ-pack)
6. [Flow Field](6-flow-field)

## Part 2

In [Part 2](part2), leveraging the generative algorithms in Part 1, we'll create a shared generative art collage, a "quilt". The quilt will be assembled from individually published generative art patches. GitHub workflow automation will automatically assemble the patches into the generative quilt.

## Part 3

In [Part 3](part3), we'll deploy an Ethereum smart contract onto the Sepolia testnet with a collection of quilt NFTs.
